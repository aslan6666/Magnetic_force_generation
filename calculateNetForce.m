% DESCRIPTION:
% This code plots the resultant force generated in the circuits resulting 
% from open sections. It initializes parameters, calculates forces on the 
% main circuit and capacitors, and plots the average net force against 
% varying distances. for more please refer to the paper:
% Net Magnetic Force Generation in Discontinuous Circuits: A Force Symmetry-Breaking Phenomenon
%
function F_net = calculateNetForce(d_0, A_start, A_end, O_prime, O, I_A, I_B)
    % Assuming calculateForce is a function that calculates the force
    % based on the positions A_start, A_end, O_prime, O, and currents I_A, I_B.
    F_AB = calculateForce(A_start, A_end, O_prime, O, I_A, I_B);
    A_start(1) = 0.25; % Adjust starting position for second calculation
    A_end(1) = 0.25;   % Adjust ending position for second calculation
    F_AB_prim = -calculateForce(A_start, A_end, O_prime, O, I_A, I_B);
    F_net = F_AB + F_AB_prim;
